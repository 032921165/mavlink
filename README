MAVLink Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library

This is a library for lightweight communication between
Micro Air Vehicles (swarm) and/or ground control stations.

It serializes C-structs for serial channels and can be used with
any type of radio modem.

To generate/update packets, select mavlink_standard_message.xml
in the QGroundControl station settings view, select mavlink/include as
the output directory and click on "Save and Generate".
You will find the newly generated/updated message_xx.h files in
the mavlink/include/generated folder.

To use MAVLink, #include the <mavlink.h> file, not the individual
message files.
